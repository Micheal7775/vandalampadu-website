<!-- ================= HISTORY ================= -->
<section id="history">
    <h2>History of Vandalampadu</h2>
    <p>
       Many centuries ago, people lived in unity in a small village called Palaya Oor (Pallayur).
       Over time, diseases, lack of clean drinking water, and natural hardships made life increasingly difficult.
      To protect their lives and future, the villagers peacefully left their homeland. Some families settled in Valan Nagar, 
      which later became today’s Vandalampadu, while others moved to nearby villages such as Kallikulam and Mullaikadu. 
      Though time has passed, the memories of Palaya Oor continue to live on through stories and old belongings 
      preserved by a few families.

<!-- ================= CHURCH ================= -->
<section id="church">
    <h2>St. Joseph’s Church</h2>
    <p>
        St. Joseph’s Church has always been the backbone of Vandalampadu village. In the early days,
        before a formal church was built, villagers gathered in homes to pray and
        worship together. These prayer meetings strengthened unity, trust, and
        spiritual discipline among the people.
        The people of Vandalampadu firmly believe that <strong>St. Joseph</strong> has
        always been their protector and guide.
        The annual church festival is celebrated with great devotion from
        <strong>August 26 to September 4</strong>.
