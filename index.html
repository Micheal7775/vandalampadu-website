    <h2>History of Vandalampadu</h2>
    <p>
        Vandalampadu village traces its roots to an ancient settlement known as
        <strong>Palaya Oor (Pallayur)</strong>. This earlier settlement existed several
        centuries ago and was home to a small but close-knit community.
        Over time, Palaya Oor faced severe natural and environmental challenges.
        Frequent illnesses, lack of clean water, and unsafe living conditions made
        daily life difficult for the residents. Houses were often damaged due to
        natural causes, and people struggled to maintain a healthy livelihood.
        Due to these hardships, many families decided to migrate peacefully in search
        of a safer and healthier place to live. Some families settled in the nearby
        area that later came to be known as <strong>Valan Nagar</strong>, which is now
        present-day Vandalampadu. Other families migrated to surrounding villages such
        as Kallikulam, Mullaikadu, and nearby regions.
        Even today, the history of Palaya Oor is preserved through oral traditions
        passed down from generation to generation. A few families still safeguard
        old belongings and artifacts that serve as living evidence of the earlier
        settlement.

    <h2>St. Joseph’s Church</h2>
    <p>
        St. Joseph’s Church has always been the backbone of Vandalampadu village. In the early days,
        before a formal church was built, villagers gathered in homes to pray and
        worship together. These prayer meetings strengthened unity, trust, and
        spiritual discipline among the people.
        The people of Vandalampadu firmly believe that <strong>St. Joseph</strong> has
        always been their protector and guide.
        The annual church festival is celebrated with great devotion from
        <strong>August 26 to September 4</strong>.
